This code is a Python script that retrieves data from a Tableau workbook and saves it into an Excel file. It uses the Tableau Server Client library to authenticate and access the workbook and the openpyxl library to create and save the Excel file. The user is prompted to enter the Tableau server web address, workbook name, and view name. The script uses a Personal Access Token to authenticate with the Tableau Server. If successful, the data is retrieved and saved into an Excel file named 'output.xlsx'.
